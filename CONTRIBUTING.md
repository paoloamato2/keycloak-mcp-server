## Ways to Contribute

| Type | How |
|------|-----|
| 🐛 Bug fix | Open an issue first, then submit a PR |
| ✨ New tool / endpoint | Discuss in an issue before writing code |
| 📝 Documentation | PRs always welcome — no issue required |
| 🔒 Security issue | See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) — **do not open a public issue** |
| 🧪 Tests | More test coverage is always appreciated |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- A Keycloak instance or a mock/test environment (no live device required for most contributions)

### Fork & clone

```bash
# 1. Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/keycloak-mcp-server.git
cd keycloak-mcp-server

# 2. Add the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/paoloamato2/keycloak-mcp-server.git

# 3. Install dependencies (including dev extras)
uv sync
```

---

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch from master
git checkout -b feat/my-new-tool

# Make your changes, then run tests
uv run pytest

# Lint / format (if ruff is available)
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format .

# Commit following the convention below
git commit -m "feat(firewall): add firewall_policy_move tool"

# Push and open a PR against master
git push origin feat/my-new-tool
```

---

## Code Style

- **Formatter:** [`ruff format`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) — 88-column line width, double quotes.
- **Linter:** `ruff check` with default rules.
- **Type hints:** All public functions and tool handlers should be fully typed.
- **Docstrings:** Use Google-style docstrings for module-level and function-level documentation.
- **Tool placement:** Add new tools to the appropriate module under `tools/`. If a tool does not fit any existing module, propose a new one in the issue first.

### Adding a new MCP tool

1. Choose the correct module in `tools/` (or propose a new one).
2. Define the tool function with full typing and a clear docstring — the docstring becomes the tool description shown to the LLM.
3. Register the tool in `server.py` if it requires registration outside the module (check how existing tools are registered).
4. Add at least one test in `tests/` covering the happy path and one error case.
